Rolling list of bugs to deal with:

Current:
Please enter known bugs here.

Fixed:
1) Output of inference from DNN should be rounded to int. (Batch 1: 1 of 3)
2) Turning the record on and then off creates an error. (Batch 1: 2 of 3)

3) Closing the UI in the Jetson nano does not exit cleanly. (Batch 1: 3 of 3) :
This was not a code-based bug, but one that was rooted in the 'windows provider'. On
the Jetson Nano, we were using the 'pygame', which has been deprecated. Kivy needs
to use 'SDL' as the window provider. To force the Kivy on the Jetson to use SDL, first
uninstall kivy and pygame:

$>pip uninstall pygame
$>pip uninstall kivy

Then make sure you have latest SDL for the Jetson stack, which at the time of this writing
is SDL 1.2:

$>sudo apt-get instal sdl1.2-dev

Then re-install kivy:

$>pip install kivy

and it should now be using SDL as the windows provider. By closing down correctly, the app will recall
your previous selections in terms of network directory and/or log directory.
